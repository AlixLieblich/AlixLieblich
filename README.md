## ✨Hello!✨

### I'm Alix, a graduate of 🌺 University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa and the Full Stack Software Engineering Bootcamp at 🍎 Hackbright Academy in San Francisco, CA with 3 years of experience in support engineering 💻💚

### Fun facts:
- I have two cats
- I care about leaving people at least a little better off than I found them
- Hobbies: reading, crocheting, and building things
